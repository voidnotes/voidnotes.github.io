> Last night I was whispering sweet nothings into the ear of a beautiful woman. Here are some of them. Today was the first day in six that I didn’t have the panini[^1].

> I cuddle up to her. 

Oh you’re so soft and warm and beautiful. Like a Costa™ Pigs in Blankets Panin.

> She pushes me away. “Oh I knew it!” Presumably in reference to my hobby of saying dumb shite.

You’re sweet and just a little fruity. Satisfying.

I want you everyday. You’re at your best when really meaty.

500 calories. Manufactured out of town.

You’re £2.44 on staff discount[^2] and take four minutes to heat.

The man in the paper rated you two stars.

[Male co-worker][^3] told me that you tasted good when I was thinking of picking you up for the first time.

> Oh thats too far? 

You aren’t really like the sandwich. I’ve got you for more than two months a year.

> This is not a sponsored post. There is just a costa in my workplace.

It’s not really inertia. Because one change in motion is easy. In November I was getting a couple of hundred words down most days. As Christmas ramped up my job gave me more hours[^1] and then after Christmas… well all my friends and family are in town!

I’m not apologising. Just re-committing and looking at my plans for the next year[^2]. Let’s try to get a good few done. And look at what I have done.

## There have been achievements in 2017

* Was happier
* Left the house more than the last year[^3]
* Started writing for a site I bought last year[^4]
* Held down job for whole year[^5]
* Left the country TWICE
* Built healthy relationship[^6]
* Started going to gigs and art with people[^7]
* Barman knowing my order at the NAC[^8]

## There are plans for 2018

* Leave the house more[^3]
* Get happier[^9]
* Finish an ARTicle[^10]
* Keep this writing up
* Visit a far away friend or two
* Keep in better contact[^3]
* Do that art project
* Ghost hunting!
* Get the cohost to write something
* Record the first episode of the VoidNotes podcast
* Make the most of any good weather

I also want to reach a point of quality and regularity where I can start telling people IRL about this project.

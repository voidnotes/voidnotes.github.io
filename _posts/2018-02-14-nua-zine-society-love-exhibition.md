Norwich University of the Arts always seems to have something going on. This Valentine’s the Zine Society had an exhibit and sale at Studio 20.
What was there?

The tiny space was decorated with sequins, paper hearts, and sweets. As with any good opening they had free drinks (and cake for earlier people). It’s a small building but the maybe 15 different publications didn’t take up too much space.  On the walls, prints from the pages were displayed.

Prints were £5 and zines £2. The zines were all on the theme of “love” and didn’t strike me as having much re-readability. But I fell in love with the work of [@nafarului](https://www.instagram.com/nufarului). I guess their zine was sold out by the time I arrived but I bought the crossed fingers print pictured below.

## What did we learn?

As for how this will influence my personal outlook or art[^1]? I don’t think I grew as a person looking at this art but I got the instagram of the artist I liked and was reminded that NUA exists. The layouts used will likely influence my scrapbooking. There was a simplicity to many of the pages. Just photos with text overlays because what else is needed to convey poetry or to suggest musicians[^2]?

## Review it?

Art: Yes, worth my time

Drinks: They had pink lemonade!

People: Looked like art students, but even more so than the crowds about the university

Almost chronological list of places I have fallen asleep when I should not have done.

I awake after eight hours sleep. I am exhausted. My body aches. I turn over and to mattress moves up to welcome me. I close my eyes. Nine hours of sleep. Harsh light crawls through my curtain-less window. It cannot touch me. Ten hours sleep. I have to get up. Have an appointment. I think about how bad it would be just to sleep through. My mother bangs on the door. I drag myself up.

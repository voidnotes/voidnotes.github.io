title: How long after breaking up with someone can you start listening to their podcast again?

footnotes:
  - I’m not going to name it and therefore him
  - While this is my business this is also his business and not the internets’
  - If I sleep ten hours a night then I had 434 hours of being awake in October. The Podcast Addict app (I know!) says I listened to 44 hours. Therefore 10.14% of each day on average
  - The pulling part isn’t on brand
  - This is my project every year. This year I am trying to review stuff. Last year I was scrapbooking
  - I am know for my… interesting taste
  - I wanted someone to take me to gigs and affection. I think if [he] was going to put his tiny amount of free time into a relationship then it should be more than a “summer romance.” A phrase I regret using
  - Term I use to describe locations I have anxiety over visiting but haven’t realised I’m avoiding them to avoid someone

So you listened to the podcast before you met the host. Then post-break up it felt weird to listen to them talk. So you unsubscribe. When does it stop being _his_ podcast and go back to being _a_ podcast?

This isn’t an answer. It’s a case study. A rough timeline is below.

As you can see, I was a listener of [unnamed podcast][^1] for a few months before I met [him][^2]. I spend 10% of my waking hours[^3] plugged in so ending up involved with a podcaster is so on brand™[^4] for me.

This was also at the beginning of my grand 2016 project: leave the fucking house for fucks sake[^5]. Looking back at how I was almost two years ago; my “not well” status was more obvious. This was better than 2014 where I would go days without leaving the house. I had a part time volunteering which forced me to get into town and I had the energy to do something more. I say energy; this was still during my constant falling asleep phase.

So I sat and listened and sometimes being a lone stranger in a room gets you noticed.

## [Him]

[He] was cute. A friend who was with me when I bumped into him this year called him “almost classically handsome,” with a surprised tone[^6]. Friendly, too. Things were nice. [He] was nice. Just a lack of communication and difference in priorities[^7] lead it to an end.

When the next episode of his show came out it felt weird listening to it.

## The gap

I have the anxiety™. This means I avoided going to local gigs for a year because I knew [he] could be there. I was scared of nothing. But I don’t know when I’m scared for a good reason or for a stupid reason. In September I visited the new Owl Sanctuary with a friend. We had a great time. Before we entered I said “I hope [he] isn’t here. [He] might hate me.”

## A reunion

[He] was there. I planned a million defenses for my being in the same room as [him]. Ready for anger or disgust. I wasn’t ready for a smile. It was disarming. We only spoke for two minutes. I was awkward, bringing up my current relationship quickly. [He] didn’t hate me.

And the local music scene is no longer cursed[^8]. I haven’t seen [him] again but I have seen some great bands.

## 2 hours 35 listened so far

I’m back listening. Working my way through the back catalog. [He] doesn’t do much of the talking. It’s about the guests. It is odd when [he] says something and I can tell if [he] is smiling but that’s no worry.

This isn’t the answer to how long to wait. A year is enough. Less probably would have been fine.

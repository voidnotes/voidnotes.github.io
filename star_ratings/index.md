  - Not sure I can call myself a writer. I am technically writing about art but not writing with any art or technique.
  - I can see the view count. Literally nobody has read my work other than a friend I linked to this.
  - Hire me! I can write 200 words per hour. They might even be medium quality.

# Star Ratings

Looking at at the work of other writers[^1] there is argument over the use of stars. A number rating being too arbitrary or reducing 600 words to an integer being bad. But that’s not my business if someone[^2] only looks at an emoji.

I’m stealing the old explanations from goodreads.com:

* 5 Stars: It was Amazing
* 4 Stars: Really Liked It
* 3 Stars: Liked It
* 2 Stars: It Was OK
* 1 Star: Did Not Like It

Note the use of “like”? It not just about the quality of a work. It’s about me. Because this is a personal project, not a professional one[^3].
